This is a nice place to put my code, so I put them here. All code should be compiled under at least C++11/C99 specification.

Now I am a CS student and I have spent only little time writing code, so you might find my code(or my English) terrible. If you find any error or have any idea to help improve my code, feel free to open an issue to help me, I'd appreciate it.
