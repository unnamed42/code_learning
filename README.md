This is the place used for code storage. Most of them are written to help understand data structure, some are written for fun.

I started coding about one year ago (about 2015-03), so I have little coding experience. Consequently, you might find my code terrible. If you find any error or have any idea to help improve my code, feel free to open an issue to help me, I'd appreciate it.

All code should be compiled under at least C++11/C99 standard. If you encounter any compile errors, please use GCC/Clang instead.
